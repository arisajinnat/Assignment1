        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
      <p>
        Park Ji-min (Korean: 박지민) was born on October 13, 1995 in Geumjeong District, Busan, South Korea.[2] His immediate family includes his mother, father, and a younger brother. When he was a child, he attended Busan's Hodong Elementary School and Yonsan Middle School.[3] During middle school, he attended Just Dance Academy and learned popping and locking dance.[citation needed] Prior to becoming a trainee, Jimin studied contemporary dance at Busan High School of Arts and was a top student in the modern dance department.[4] After a teacher suggested he audition with an entertainment company, it led him to Big Hit Entertainment. Once he passed the auditions in 2012, he transferred to Korean Arts High School, graduating in 2014.[5]
